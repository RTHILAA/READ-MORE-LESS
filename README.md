## Features :

- Clean, responsive design with smooth animations
- "Read More/Less" button that toggles additional content
- Fade-in animation when page loads
- Ripple effect on button click
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Smooth transitions for showing/hiding content

## Technologies Used :

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with animations and transitions)
- JavaScript (ES6)

## How It Works :

1. The page loads with a fade-in animation
2. The initial text shows with an ellipsis (...) indicating more content is available
3. Clicking the "Read More" button:
   - Hides the ellipsis
   - Shows the additional content with a fade-in animation
   - Changes the button text to "Read Less"
4. Clicking "Read Less" reverses the process

## Customization :

You can easily customize:
- The text content in `index.html`
- The styling in `style.css` (colors, fonts, animations)
- The behavior in `script.js`

## Responsive Design :

The layout adapts to different screen sizes:
- On larger screens: Content has fixed maximum width
- On mobile devices (≤768px): Content takes 90% of screen width

## Browser Support :

The project supports all modern browsers including:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
